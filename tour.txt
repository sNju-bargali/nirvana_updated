Hi sanjay,

Here is the design of the Store page:
https://invis.io/7XRQ6GJY9FD#/360137295_Store

When you scroll on each image, there should be a rollover style, similar to:
https://shop.eminem.com/

For the first 2 tshirts, copy the clickable text from the eminem link. Bas sirf first click tak he rakhna.

Also, add a filter for topware and sticker. If I click on topware, only the first 5 images should appear. If I click on sticker, 6th image should appear.
